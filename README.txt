Q1:
Nature of a process is considered to be static. Either batch or interactive.
Hence, if an FCFS process is pre-empted, its re-queued into the FCFS queue only
regardless of the left-over burst time.

Q2:
There won't be any deadlocks since ordering in allocation is same. But there can be
live-locks, if OS is not able to collect resources for the next process. In this case, state of
system doesn't change, we terminate the program entirely.
